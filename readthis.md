My name is Quinn Carmello and I am attending SOWELA for its IT program. I am under the software concentration. I am 22 and married to my beautiful wife 😯 and have 4 fur babies, 3 dachshunds and an orange tabby cat. I am very passionate at skateboarding 🛹 and would like to open up my own business revoling around the sport one day. Taking mobile app development hopefully will give me new skills that I could apply to this dream of mine in the future. wow
